# Data Sources and Provenance

This document describes all data sources used in the Medicaid Provider Dashboard, including their origins, processing methods, and limitations.

## üìä Primary Data Sources

### 1. Medicaid Provider Claims Data

**Source**: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
**System**: T-MSIS (Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System)
**Coverage**: 2016-2020
**File**: `files/theme/medicaid_src/county-table.txt`, `state-table.txt`, `national-table.txt`

**Description**:
- Provider counts by specialty, county, and year
- Medicaid beneficiary population estimates
- Provider-to-population ratios per 100,000 beneficiaries
- Percentage of providers participating in Medicaid

**Data Quality Notes**:
- Some states have data quality flags due to incomplete T-MSIS reporting
- States with data quality issues are marked but included with caveats
- Provider counts aggregated by specialty and volume categories
- Data reflects fee-for-service and managed care claims

**Limitations**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2021 data not yet available from CMS
- Does not include providers who see only private insurance patients
- May undercount providers in managed care-dominated states
- Puerto Rico included in data but not displayed on map

### 2. Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC)

**Source**: USDA Economic Research Service
**Dataset**: 2023 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes
**URL**: https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/rural-urban-continuum-codes
**Downloaded**: September 30, 2025
**File**: `Data Preprocessing/county_rucc_2023.json`

**Description**:
- Official USDA classification of all US counties into 9 categories
- Based on 2020 Census and Office of Management and Budget metro area delineations
- Distinguishes metro counties by population size
- Distinguishes nonmetro counties by urbanization and adjacency to metro areas

**Classification Scheme**:
```
Metro Counties (1,252 total):
  1. Metro areas of 1 million+ population        (483 counties)
  2. Metro areas of 250,000-1 million population (398 counties)
  3. Metro areas of <250,000 population          (371 counties)

Nonmetro Counties (1,981 total):
  4. Urban 20K+, adjacent to metro               (204 counties)
  5. Urban 20K+, not adjacent to metro           (81 counties)
  6. Urban 2,500-19,999, adjacent to metro       (385 counties)
  7. Urban 2,500-19,999, not adjacent to metro   (248 counties)
  8. Urban <5,000, adjacent to metro             (468 counties)
  9. Urban <5,000, not adjacent to metro         (595 counties)
```

**Important Changes in 2023**:
- Urban area population threshold changed from 2,500 to 5,000
- Some Virginia independent cities combined with surrounding counties
- Codes updated after each decennial census

**Data Quality**:
- ‚úÖ Official USDA data - scientifically valid
- ‚úÖ Covers all 3,233 US counties and county-equivalents
- ‚úÖ Validated against known major metro areas

### 3. Geographic Boundaries

**Source**: U.S. Census Bureau
**Dataset**: TIGER/Line Shapefiles
**Year**: 2018
**Format**: TopoJSON (simplified from original shapefile)
**File**: `files/theme/medicaid_src/tl_2018_us_simplified.json`

**Description**:
- County and state boundaries for mapping
- Simplified geometry for web performance
- Does not include Puerto Rico, U.S. territories

**Coverage**:
- 3,142 county/county-equivalent boundaries
- 50 states + District of Columbia
- Albers USA projection optimized for continental US

**Limitations**:
- Boundaries from 2018 may not reflect recent county changes
- Simplified geometry may lack precision for detailed analysis
- Puerto Rico and territories not included

### 4. Data Quality Indicators

**Source**: Custom analysis of T-MSIS data
**File**: `files/theme/medicaid_src/state_dq.csv`

**Description**:
- Flags for states with known T-MSIS reporting issues
- Separate flags for outpatient (OT) and prescription (RX) claims
- Used to display warnings and exclude from rankings when appropriate

## üîÑ Data Processing

### Provider Data Processing

1. **Aggregation**: Raw claims data aggregated to county level
2. **Specialty Mapping**: Claims mapped to 6 provider specialty categories
3. **Volume Filtering**: Providers grouped by Medicaid beneficiary volume
4. **Ratio Calculation**: Providers per 100,000 Medicaid beneficiaries
5. **Ranking**: Quintile-based rankings at national and state levels

### RUCC Data Processing

1. **Download**: Official Excel file from USDA ERS
2. **Parsing**: Extracted FIPS codes and RUCC classifications
3. **Categorization**: Mapped 9 RUCC codes to 4 simplified categories:
   - Metro (1-3)
   - Nonmetro Adjacent (4, 6, 8)
   - Nonmetro Remote (5, 7)
   - Frontier (9)
4. **Validation**: Verified against known major metro counties
5. **JSON Conversion**: Structured for web dashboard integration

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations and Caveats

### Data Currency

- **Provider data latest year**: 2020
- **RUCC classifications**: 2023 (based on 2020 Census)
- **Geographic boundaries**: 2018

**Impact**: 2021 COVID-19 pandemic effects not reflected in provider data.

### Geographic Coverage

- **Mainland US**: Complete coverage ‚úÖ
- **Puerto Rico**: Data available but not displayed on map ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Territories**: Not included ‚ùå

**Impact**: 78 Puerto Rico municipalities have provider data but won't appear on map.

### Data Quality Variations

States with T-MSIS data quality flags should be interpreted cautiously:
- May undercount providers
- Rankings may not be directly comparable
- Clearly marked on dashboard with gray coloring

### Provider Counting Methodology

- **Counted once per specialty per volume category**
- **May practice across multiple counties** (counted in each)
- **Volume categories may overlap** in raw data
- **Managed care data completeness varies** by state

## üìà Data Validation

### Validation Tests Performed

1. ‚úÖ RUCC data matches official USDA distribution
2. ‚úÖ Major metros correctly classified (NYC, LA, Chicago, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ FIPS codes consistent across all datasets
4. ‚úÖ Provider ratios mathematically validated
5. ‚úÖ Geographic boundaries align with FIPS codes

### Known Validation Issues

- 78 Puerto Rico counties in data not in map ‚úì Documented
- San Diego County correctly shows as RUCC 1 ‚úì Fixed with official data
- RUCC 9 (frontier) counties: 595 in official data ‚úì Corrected

## üí° Best Practices for Data Users

### Interpretation Guidelines

1. **Check data quality flags** before comparing states
2. **Consider time lag** - data reflects 2016-2020 provider landscape
3. **Account for methodology** - managed care vs fee-for-service
4. **Use RUCC codes appropriately** - 9 categories vs 4 simplified
5. **Understand limitations** - provider counts, not patient access

### Recommended Use Cases

‚úÖ **Appropriate Uses**:
- Comparing provider supply across counties/states
- Analyzing rural-urban disparities in provider access
- Tracking trends over 2016-2020 period
- Identifying potential provider shortage areas

‚ùå **Inappropriate Uses**:
- Measuring actual patient access to care
- Determining individual provider quality
- Making 2021+ predictions without caveats
- Direct comparison of states with data quality flags
